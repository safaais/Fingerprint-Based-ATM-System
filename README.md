## Overview
The Fingerprint-Based ATM System replaces traditional PIN-based ATM authentication with fingerprint biometrics for enhanced security. Users authenticate themselves using their fingerprint to perform transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries.

---

## Features
1. **Secure Authentication**: Uses biometric fingerprint scanning for identity verification.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive system for easy transactions.
3. **Database Integration**: Securely stores user details and transaction history.
4. **Real-Time Transactions**: Instant updates to account balances.
5. **Enhanced Security**: Eliminates the risk of PIN theft or forgetting passwords.

---

## Requirements
### Hardware
- Fingerprint Scanner (e.g., R305, ZFM-20, or any compatible module)
- Raspberry Pi/Arduino (for edge computing) or PC
- ATM-style keypad and screen
- Cash dispenser (optional for full ATM simulation)

### Software
- Python (Backend)
- SQLite/MySQL (Database)
- Flask or Django (for API/Interface)
- PyFingerprint Library (for fingerprint scanner integration)

### Libraries and Dependencies
- `pyfingerprint`
- `flask` or `django`
- `sqlite3` or `mysql-connector`
- `tkinter` (for GUI)
- `RPi.GPIO` (if using Raspberry Pi for hardware integration)

---

## System Architecture
1. **Fingerprint Scanner**: Captures and verifies fingerprints.
2. **Backend System**: Manages user authentication, transactions, and database operations.
3. **Database**: Stores user details such as fingerprint data (encrypted), account information, and transaction history.
4. **GUI/API**: Provides an interface for users to interact with the system.

---

## Implementation Steps
### Step 1: Fingerprint Enrollment
- Users register their fingerprint during account setup.
- The system saves a hashed version of the fingerprint data in the database.

### Step 2: Fingerprint Authentication
- The user places their finger on the scanner during login.
- The system matches the scanned fingerprint with the stored data.

### Step 3: Transaction Handling
- After successful authentication:
  - Display account options (e.g., balance inquiry, withdrawal, deposit).
  - Process the transaction and update the database.

### Step 4: Database Management
- Maintain separate tables for users, accounts, and transaction history.
- Use encryption for sensitive data.

### Step 5: Hardware Integration
- Connect the fingerprint scanner, keypad, and display to the system.
- Use GPIO or serial communication for hardware interaction.

## Main Parts of Code

### 1. Fingerprint Authentication
```python
from pyfingerprint.pyfingerprint import PyFingerprint

def enroll_fingerprint():
    try:
        f = PyFingerprint('/dev/ttyUSB0', 57600, 0xFFFFFFFF, 0x00000000)

        if f.verifyPassword():
            print("Place your finger on the scanner...")
            while not f.readImage():
                pass
            
            f.convertImage(0x01)
            position = f.storeTemplate()
            print(f"Fingerprint enrolled successfully at position {position}")
            return position
        else:
            print("Failed to connect to fingerprint scanner.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

def authenticate_fingerprint():
    try:
        f = PyFingerprint('/dev/ttyUSB0', 57600, 0xFFFFFFFF, 0x00000000)

        if f.verifyPassword():
            print("Place your finger on the scanner...")
            while not f.readImage():
                pass
            
            f.convertImage(0x01)
            position = f.searchTemplate()
            
            if position[0] >= 0:
                print("Authentication successful!")
                return True
            else:
                print("Authentication failed.")
                return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
